## Sign Up Page
If a user needs to sign up, this is where they will input a username and password. Then it brings up another form to input basic info for their starter profile.

## Profile Page

Once a user has either logged in or completed the sign up form, they will be brought to their own profile page. Here, they can update their photo or information on their profile.

Once a user is logged in, they can use the navigation bar fully to access their friends, messages, and search features.
