Today I worked on:
The group was a little short-staffed today, so we each broke up to code on our own. I started the day by going over pydantic, because I am a bit confused on how the models work. After, I started working on the front-end design for a list friends feature. 

## October 13, 2022 

Today I worked on:

*Creating a friends feature*
Today, Sorena and I pair-programmed where I was the primary coder. We re-evaluated how we wanted our followers table to be, and modified it to act more like a friend's list. 

We didn't think we had the ability to create a functional list of friends for users and we were both ecstatic that we got it to work.

Today I worked on:

*Creating a follower feature*
Sorena and I pair-programmed today, where she was primarily coding. We created a table
for followers, which has an id which is the primary key, a followee and a follower which
referenced the profile id. We also created a create method to create a new follow instance.

We had a conversation about proceeding with the friends list, which may be harder to implement
within our deadline, or to go for a follow feature instead which would be more
manageable. And then go for a friends list as a stretch goal. 

It is useful to create an id for each table acting as the primary key. And it is
also important to make sure you are returning the correct pydantic model in your
queries!

*self-study*

Today, I continued self-study, going over postgres and databases

## October 5, 2022

Today I worked on:

*group-build*

Today, we all had a pair programming session together, where the most confident member (America) drove. She explained any gaps in knowledge that we had with FastAPI. 

We set ujp our routers and queries for our profile services as well as created pydantic models.

## October 4, 2022

Today I worked on:

*Self-study and catch-up*
Today I refreshed my knowledge of React as well as FastAPI, I felt behind the group and wanted to familiarize myself with the material.

Today, I worked on:

*Setting up Docker.*

We all discussed the order in which we would implement our MVPs
We started to draw out and plan each microservice and set up Docker services.
