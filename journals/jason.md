Today, I worked on:

*Setting up the docker files and ghi folder with my team.*

Before getting started, we all discussed how we should approach our MVPs.
We all agreed that we will follow the order of our Excalidraw pages as
the order of importance for implementing those functions.

We realized we needed to have Services and Volumes on their own so 
when we run the command to bring up docker containers, it is able
to also create the volume.

Today, I worked on:

*getting the api up and running*

BBefore getting started, the team discussed what we wanted the api endpoints to look like.

We were interested in which database to use, and decided to work with postgres. 
We got the database set up and created two endpoints.
