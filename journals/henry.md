Today we got the starter project and worked on configuring it.
Sorena and Ikenna shared their screens while everyone else
observed and tried to help if they came across any issues.
We came across one issue that stumped us all where the
docker-compose.yaml file needed volumes on the outer level.
Everything was working how it should be by the end of the day.

Today I worked on implementing the Magic Bell notification API.
I installed it onto the ghi container that handles React components
on my gitlab branch. I came across 69 vulnerabilities and tried
running "npm audit fix" and "npm audit fix --force" but those ran
into some errors.
