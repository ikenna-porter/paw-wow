Today we got the starter project and worked on configuring it.
Sorena and Ikenna shared their screens while everyone else
observed and tried to help if they came across any issues.
We came across one issue that stumped us all where the
docker-compose.yaml file needed volumes on the outer level.
Everything was working how it should be by the end of the day.

Today I worked on implementing the Magic Bell notification API.
I installed it onto the ghi container that handles React components
on my gitlab branch. I came across 69 vulnerabilities and tried
running "npm audit fix" and "npm audit fix --force" but those ran
into some errors. I met with the cohort lead, Tai, and told her
one of my goals this module was to ask more questions and I think
we came to a goal of at least 2 questions a week.

America was the driver today and we worked on creating tables in
the database today. I followed along by watching the exploration
videos from this weekend and found it helpful. During individual
work time, I watched a little bit of the videos and was able to
follow along a lot better while America was live coding. America
was very on top of everything and was able to answer the questions
I had. We ran into some issues that were resolved quickly.
